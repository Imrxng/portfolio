          I am a driven full-stack developer who enjoys taking on new challenges
          and is always looking for ways to improve my skills. With extensive
          experience in API development, C#, object-oriented programming (OOP),
          JavaScript, TypeScript, MySQL, MongoDB, Git, and security, I deliver
          quality solutions. Additionally, I work with frameworks such as React,
          Express, Next.js, and React Native. Whether in a Scrum or Agile team
          or working independently, I ensure that the work is completed on time
          and to the satisfaction of the client. You can count on me for
          dedication, customer focus, and delivering high-quality solutions!
